### Free wifi for your guests

Whether on holiday, business travel, in a restaurant or the waiting room at the dentists’, people want to remain in contact with their friends, relations and the latest news.

Internet technology offers them the possibility to do so, most certainly after the latest generation of notebooks, PDA and iPhones appeared on the market.

Quite often it is very expensive to surf for an hour, and that may scare off people. Exactly the way you dislike paying too much for any purchase, your clients hate to pay 5 Euros or more extra for one hour on the internet. Only the major telecom operators gain a bundle on this!

There is another way! GratWiFi® allows you to offer your guests free surfing. Your investment is modest, your business will benefit from it by attracting new guests.
